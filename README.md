# Taxi Fare Guru: Machine Learning Project

## Overview:
Welcome to the Taxi Fare Guru project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict taxi fares based on various input features such as distance, pickup time, location, and other relevant factors. By leveraging historical taxi fare data and machine learning algorithms, we seek to create an accurate and reliable predictor that can assist in estimating taxi fares for future rides.

## Project Structure:
### Data: 
This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model. The dataset includes features such as pickup and dropoff coordinates, timestamp, and fare amount.

### Notebooks: 
This directory contains Colab notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and tuning. Each notebook is focused on a specific stage of the machine learning pipeline, allowing for clear documentation of the project's progress and methodologies.

### Src: 
This directory contains Python scripts for modularizing code related to data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. By organizing code into separate modules, we aim to enhance code readability, reusability, and maintainability.

### Models: 
This directory stores trained machine learning models serialized in a format such as pickle or joblib. These models can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data without retraining.
